## **Session 1: Overview of Data Analysis & Excel’s Role**

### **Concepts:**
1. **Introduction to Excel as a Data Analysis Tool**  
   - Importance of Excel in Data Analytics, Finance, Business Intelligence, and Research.
   - Overview of spreadsheets, workbooks, cells, rows, and columns.
   
2. **Essential Excel Features for Data Analysts**  
   - Sorting and Filtering Data.
   - Basic Formula Bar operations.
   - Understanding cell references: Absolute ($A$1), Relative (A1), and Mixed ($A1, A$1).
   
### **Examples:**
#### **Basic Sorting & Filtering:**
1. Open an Excel dataset containing a sales report (e.g., Date, Product, Sales, Region).
2. Use the **Sort** function to arrange sales data in ascending/descending order.
3. Apply the **Filter** function to show only sales greater than $10,000.

### **Classwork:**
**Basic Level:**
- Open an Excel sheet and enter sample student scores.
- Sort students in descending order of their scores.
- Filter students who scored above 70.

**Intermediate Level:**
- Load a sample company sales dataset.
- Sort sales by region.
- Filter out sales made before 2022.

**Advanced Level:**
- Given a dataset of employee salaries, filter employees earning above a specific threshold and sort them by department.
- Extract the top 5 highest earners.

### **Real-World Implication & Case Study:**
- A retail company uses sorting and filtering to analyze monthly sales and identify top-performing regions.
- An HR department uses filtering to shortlist candidates based on experience levels.

## **Session 2: Formatting and Conditional Formatting**

### **Concepts:**
1. **Data Formatting for Better Insights**  
   - Adjusting column width and row height.
   - Using number formatting (Currency, Percentage, Date, etc.).
   - Freezing panes for easy navigation.

2. **Conditional Formatting for Data Visualization**  
   - Highlighting duplicate values.
   - Creating color scales to visually represent data trends.
   - Using icon sets to indicate performance (e.g., Green = Good, Red = Poor).
   
### **Examples:**
#### **Conditional Formatting for Performance Tracking:**
1. Apply color scales to highlight high and low sales figures.
2. Use data bars to show comparative values within a column.
3. Highlight sales below a certain threshold in red.

### **Classwork:**
**Basic Level:**
- Format a dataset of student grades using number formatting.
- Apply conditional formatting to highlight all failing grades (<50).

**Intermediate Level:**
- Given a dataset of product sales, format currency values.
- Use conditional formatting to highlight the top 10% highest sales.

**Advanced Level:**
- Create a performance tracker for employees based on their sales figures.
- Apply a 3-color scale: Green for top 20%, Yellow for average, and Red for bottom 20%.

### **Real-World Implication & Case Study:**
- A financial analyst uses conditional formatting to quickly identify underperforming investments.
- A school administrator highlights students needing academic intervention based on grades.
