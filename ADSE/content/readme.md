Let’s design a detailed course plan for your two-semester program, spanning three months per semester, with three 2-hour sections per week (total 18 hours/month per course). Each section will include theory, examples, classwork, and a weekly assignment to ensure a balanced learning experience. Since Semester 1 includes some completed courses (*Building Modern Websites*, *UI/UX for Responsive Web Design*, *Frontend Web Development with React*, and *eProject - Responsive Website Development*), I’ll focus on the remaining courses for Semester 1 and all of Semester 2.
