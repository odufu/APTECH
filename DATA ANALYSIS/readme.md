Below is one way to restructure your course into three modules—Excel, T‑SQL, and PowerBI—with a 4‑month (16‑week) timeline. In this proposal, we’ve reallocated content so that each module is deep enough for hands‑on practice while still fitting into a reduced overall duration.

### Revised Course Overview

- **Total Duration:** 4 months (16 weeks)  
- **Sessions per Week:** 3 sessions (2 hours each)  
- **Total Instructional Hours:** 48 sessions × 2h = 96 hours  
- **Self‑Study Hours:** (Can be scaled to roughly 20–25 hours overall to reinforce key concepts)

### Additional Considerations

- **Self‑Study & Labs:**  
  In this streamlined format, self‑study activities (e.g., reading assignments, practice exercises) can be allocated as homework to reinforce the lab sessions. You might target 1–1.5 hours of self‑study per week depending on the module’s complexity.

- **Pacing & Flexibility:**  
  The schedule allows for hands‑on labs, mini‑projects, and review sessions. You can adjust the depth of coverage based on student progress or incorporate an extra session if a module needs additional time.

- **Integration & Capstone:**  
  The final week (Week 16) is dedicated to a capstone project that requires students to combine the skills learned in Excel, T‑SQL, and PowerBI, reinforcing the interconnected nature of the tools.

This proposal maintains a balanced approach:
- **Excel** builds foundational data manipulation skills.
- **T‑SQL** equips students with database querying techniques.
- **PowerBI** rounds out the course by focusing on data visualization and reporting with an emphasis on integrating prior knowledge.

You can adjust session topics and durations slightly based on your audience’s background or institutional needs.
